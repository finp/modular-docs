// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id="my-concept-module-a-{context}"]
// * Title: = My concept module A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="using_text_snippets_or_text_fragments-{context}"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes a variable that sets the context, such as {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Text Snippets or Text Fragments (Pseudo-modules)
//In the title of concept modules, include nouns or noun phrases that are used in the body text. This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.
//Do not start the title of concept modules with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

[NOTE]
The following standard is recommended when the documentation is being maintained without a Content Management System (CMS) capable of managing complex interrelations between modules.

The use of reusable text snippet files (or text fragment files) is discouraged due to the complications that can arise due to the complexity they introduce.

Snippet (fragment) file use should be limited to:

* Standardized admonitions (such as 'Technology preview' and 'Beta' text).
* Where there is an existing standard between the upstream and downstream communities.
